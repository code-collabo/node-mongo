```

3. Unlink (for when you are done developing):

npm unlink
```

Contributors are to run the project as described on the API boilerplate templates repo readme: [https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-api-boilerplate-templates](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-api-boilerplate-templates)

How to handle the `.env` files is different during code development:

- Retain the `.env.example` file so that it doesn't get deleted from our repo when you are submitting your code fix

- Create a copy of the `.env.example` file, rename this copy to `.env` , then change the `PORT` and add other environment variables to store your secrets as desired.
