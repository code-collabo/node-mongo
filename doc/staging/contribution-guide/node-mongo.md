### Contributor's individual project development guide

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="CLI" %}
Contributors are to run the CLI commands and flags as described on the CLI repo readme: [https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-cli](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-cli)

The method of installation is different during code development:

1. clone the node-mongo-cli repo (you should fork it first)

2. go to the root folder of the node-mongo cli repo cloned (where the package.json is located) 

3. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

4. Link after installing dependencies (i.e add to global packages):

```
npm link
```
or
```
npm install -g i .
```

5. confirm if the node-mongo-cli package is installed globally:

```
npm list -g
```
you should see @code-collabo/node-mongo-cli as part of the listed global packages

6. Unlink i.e remove the package globally (for when you are done developing):

```
npm uninstall -g @code-collabo/node-mongo-cli
```
or
```
npm unlink
```
7. confirm if the package has been uninstalled globally

```
npm list -g
```
you should not see @code-collabo/node-mongo-cli as part of the listed global packages

{% tab title="API boilerplate templates" %}
Contributors are to run the project as described on the API boilerplate templates repo readme: [https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-api-boilerplate-templates](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-api-boilerplate-templates)

How to handle the `.env` files is different during code development:

* Retain the `.env.example` file so that it doesn't get deleted from our repo when you are submitting your code fix
* Create a copy of the `.env.example` file, rename this copy to `.env` , then change the `PORT` and add other environment variables to store your secrets as desired.
